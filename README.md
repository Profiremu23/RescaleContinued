# Rescale Coutinued

About the mod: 

Are you ever thinked about stock scaled Kerbol system is too easy?
Or stock engines are overpowered in the default scale?
Do you tired from planets are too small to even be called planets?
Do you ever wished for larger planets?
This mod is for you! The Rescale Coutinued is a small mod used with Sigma Dimensions to change the universal scale!
You can select 2x, 2.5x, 3.2x, 5.4x, 7.5x, and even 10x scale to make the planets larger!



# Scale examples (PLANNED):

2x Scale: Is for a simple taste for advanced players to try larger stock planets.

2.5x and 3.2x Scale: is for players to play the stock system larger than 2x scale, but still want to use stock parts.

5.4x Scale: 50% Earth scale, if you want to play on this scale with stock parts, i recommend to use Real Fuels or SMURFF to balance the stock parts.

7.6x Scale: 75% Earth scale, this scale is really hard to play with unmodded stock parts.

10.0x and 10.618x Scale: On this scale, every stock planet is 1:1 copies of real life counterparts.
